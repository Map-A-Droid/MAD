You need to have the gettext toolkit installed (on ubuntu run sudo apt install gettext)

Translate task texts from questGen.py:

From the MAD base folder:
> xgettext -d base -o locale\quest.po mapadroid\utils\questGen.py

Go into the locale folder and update the translation files for german and french:

> msgmerge --update de/LC_MESSAGES/quest.po quest.po
> msgmerge --update fr/LC_MESSAGES/quest.po quest.po

Replace quest.pot with the new generated quest.po
> rm quest.pot
> mv quest.po quest.pot

Next step, use POEdit (https://poedit.net/ ) to translate the files. Once you are done, make sure you save your po file. 
Then, make sure you COMPILE your po file into a mo file (you can find this option in the file menu).

NB! The updated quest.pot file + the quest.po + quest.mo files in LC_MESSGES all needs to be commited


There are a few static json-files that also needs to be translated, either compare changes from the locale/en folder or copy the untranslated files from there:
- items.json - names the inventory items for quest rewards and also for some quest conditions
- pokemonTypes - names the types of pokemon
- types.json - names the quest types and provides base translation of a lot of quest
- quest_templates - translates quests based on template names - will override any logic and translations done elsewhere.
